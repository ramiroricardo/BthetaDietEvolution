# Diet leaves genetic signature in a keystone member of the gut microbiota

### Abstract
Code repository for the analysis of experimental evolution of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron during adaptation to the mouse gut under different dietary regimes.  

Link: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3907580

### Overview
The .Rmd files contain all of the analysis, except those that were carried with Graphpad Prism. Bash or R scripts are called from the .Rmd files.

Intermediate files are in the data and analysis folders. 

Cloning/downloading this repository, and oppening BthetaDietEvolution.Rproj (RStudio) will allow rendering each of the .Rmd files into html files with statistical output and figures.
